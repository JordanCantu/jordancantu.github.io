## Welcome 

My name is Jordan, and some years ago, I realized that I was not in control of my life. Many of the goals I set for myself in college were influenced by the people around me. I looked around and saw many who were choosing to live their life wanting more: more prestige, more influence, more things. At the time, I accepted the belief that living this way was the path of success, and with success would come stability - a feeling I have been desperately searching for since childhood. So, unaware of any alternative, I trudged along this path, slowly accumulating an immense weight of unmet expectations. I ignored my anxiety, depression, and stress, and I pushed my body to its limit. I pushed aside what I truly valued in life because I thought that a small existence would be considered a failure to the people I had come to know. I became deeply unhappy, and I realized it was because I was living a life that was not my own. 

So when I graduated college, I returned to my home town to focus on the things that mattered. It took a long time, but over the next ten years, I focused on stripping back all the junk that had made me someone I didnâ€™t recognize. In this unlearning, I discovered what I really wanted in life. I decided that I would live a small life, and by living a small life, I would lead a happy one. I got rid of most of my material things, cut connections with people who did not add value to my life, and asked for help with my mental health. I have slowed the pace of my living by several notches, and now relish the slowness. In many ways, I reset my life in order to build it back with more control. 

There are still many days when old thoughts and insecurities flood my mind and there often seems to be no outlet for relief. My hope is to stabilize some of that chaos of thought by putting words, no matter how mundane, out into the world. I don't consider myself a writer - just an average person who finds steadiness in writing things down and who has often found motivation and affirmation in the words of others. So, in the event that some of my words connect with someone, I will have felt that I've given something back. 

If you take time from your life to read any of my words, thank you.
