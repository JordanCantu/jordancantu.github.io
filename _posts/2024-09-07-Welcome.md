## Welcome 

My name is Jordan. There are days when my thoughts flood my mind, and in that seemingly unrestricted space, there often seems to be no outlet for relief. My hope is to relocate some of that chaos of thought by putting words, no matter how mundane, out into the world. I don't consider myself a writer - just an average person who needs a break and who has often found reprieve in the words of others. So, in the event that some of my words connect with someone, I will have felt that I've given something back. 

If you taken time from your life to read any of my words, thank you.
